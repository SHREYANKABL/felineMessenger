## ❓ What is felineMessenger?

**felineMessenger** is a messaging application designed from the ground up for complete anonymity, identity protection, and zero leaks. You cannot trace it by IP address or access it through an admin panel—those concepts simply do not exist here. Every component is crafted with paranoia in mind.

---

## 🧠 Architecture

The entire architecture is built on **gRPC + Boost.Asio**, ensuring full asynchronous data control, encryption at all layers, and thoughtful storage through Kafka, Redis, and SQL clusters.

### Key Components:

- 🔹 **Frontend on React**: Communicates with the API Gateway via `gRPC-Web` over `HTTPS`.
- 🔹 **API Gateway**: The single entry point, utilizing `mTLS gRPC` encryption.
- 🔹 **Boost.Asio Core**: A high-performance event loop, managing TCP connections and communication logic.
- 🔹 **Authorization**: Employs JWT and Redis for quick verification.
- 🔹 **Message Queue**: Uses Kafka for message queuing, equipped with AES encryption and caching.
- 🔹 **Storage**: Data is securely stored, ensuring no leaks or unauthorized access.
